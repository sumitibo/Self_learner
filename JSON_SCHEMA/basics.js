/*The $schema keyword states that this schema is written according to a specific draft of the standard and used for a variety of reasons, primarily version control.
The $id keyword defines a URI for the schema, and the base URI that other URI references within the schema are resolved against.
The title and description annotation keywords are descriptive only. They do not add constraints to the data being validated. The intent of the schema is stated with these two keywords.
The type validation keyword defines the first constraint on our JSON data and in this case it has to be a JSON Object.

{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "$id": "https://example.com/product.schema.json",
    "title": "Product",
    "description": "A product in the catalog",
    "type": "object"
}*/
